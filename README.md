# F7_MaterialHeader
I'm trying to replicate the 'shrinking header' and moving title in Material designed apps with the awesome Framework7 (http://www.idangero.us/framework7). Best example is the group information page of WhatsApp.

# Preview
Will be uploaded if MaterialHeader is fully perfected

# Contribute
Since I'm just a simple boy who doesn't have much knowledge with Javascript I need every helping hand to get this thing running :)
Clone this repo, swing your wand and do your magic and make pull requests ;)

# ToDo
- smooth the transition of title
- clean up code
- get implemented in Framework7's core :P
